## Design

  ### Design Choices
  The layout I chose ensures each specific point of information is easy 
  to access and follows a similar theme to ensure continuity. Kavita's 
  Beauty Bay is a new, indian authentic beauty salon. I want the 
  website clean to represent that.
  

### Colours
As Kavita's Beauty Bay is an indian beauty salon I wanted to add hints of authentic and classic colour (balck and pastel brown, pinkish close to the nature).

The colours I choose are Black, White, slightly pink (background)and light brown.

Specific colours used on the site all taken from a colour picker in InDesign are:
1. Light black: #212529;
2. White: #fffff;
3. Off-white: #fafafa 
4. Light pink: #fbf7fc;
5. Light brown: rgb(220, 210, 210)
6. Orange: orange;

After deciding on the colours I tested them on WebAIM to make sure how the contrast between them worked best.

### Fonts

Fonts were used:
- Alex Brush
- Montserrat
- Sans-serif

I use these fonts as they are clean, easy to read and have a smart appearance and as they are not a commonly used fonts.

### Structure
The page is structured in a user friendly and visually appealing way. Upon arriving the user will notice the recognisable navigation bar, with the company logo on the center. 
All navigation links are placed on the left and right of the company logo.

The website consists of four separate pages: 

- A homepage with a section giving more information on the club (Strapline and short introduction, gallery, reviews and map),
- An Treatments page with information on the founders and why they started the club,
- A Gallery page that introduces the user to the coaches,
- A Contact page with a form for getting in touch.

## Bugs and fixes

- My Codeanywhere credits has been ran out, so I just bought new credits.

- All navbar menus link has to be changed in the Header on all page from 
  href="/index.html"> to  href="index.html">. Without this 
  modification you will get 404 error. 

- Having tested the Contact us page map and form position on all 
  devices. I noticed using a form size of a specific px cause them to be 
  out of place on different devices. Using a ' width:120px' unit  with 
  specific media queries commands instead allows them respond better 
  ensuring they are in a good position on all devices.

##### Media Query commands
```css
        @media(max-width: 994px) {
    
    .nav-link {
        margin-top: 5px;
        margin-left: 15px;
    }

    .nav {
        margin-left: 25px;
    }
 
    .navbar-nav {
        gap: 1px;
    }

    .navbar-toggler-icon {
        color:rgb(220, 210, 210);
    }

    .logo {
        display: none;
    }

    .main-header{
        min-width: 100%;
        margin-left: 10px;
    }

    .logos {
        margin-left: 10px;
    }

    .supplier-logo {
        padding-left: 10px;
        justify-content: center;
    }

    .pricelist-header{
        min-width: 100%;
        margin-left: 10px;
        text-align: center;
    }

    .treatments-table {
        font-family: Alex Brush;
        margin-left: 10px;
    }
    .treatments-photo {
        display: none;
    }

    .offer-photo {
        display: none;
    }

    .container .contact-form input {
        width: 140px;
    }

    .container .contact-form textarea {
        width: 140px;
    }

    .container .contact-form .btn-send {
        width: 140px;
    }

    .container .map {
        margin-top: 15px;
    }
    .offer-card {
        margin-left: 0px;
    }

    .contact {
        margin-top: 23px;
        padding-left: 25px;
    }    
}
```
##### MAP
The map had a grey line under so wasn't flush to the footer, after using 
google inspect I noticed the container was a different height the map so 
matched both heights to 400px which fixed the issue.

#### Original code
```css
            .map {
                height: 602px;
                width: 100%;
            }
```
#### Code fix
```css
            .map {
                height: 602px;
                width: 100%;
            }

            .map iframe {
                height: 530px;
                width: 100%;
                }
```
